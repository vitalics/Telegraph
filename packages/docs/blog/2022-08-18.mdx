Version 1.2 was missed due to releasing issue.

The new telegraph component was landed and available on [`npm.js`](https://npmjs.com) site.

## [fmt](https://github.com/vitalics/telegraph/packages/fmt/)

This is not actually a "component" but it includes helpful formatting

Installation:

`npm i @tlgr/fmt`

How it works:

```jsx title=example.ts
import { fmt, bold } from "@tlgr/fmt";
import { Telegraf } from "telegraf";

const bot = new Telegraf("<API TOKEN>");

bot.start((ctx) => {
  // send message
  ctx.reply(...fmt(`Hello with ${bold("bold")} message`)); // hello with bold message
});

bot.launch();
```
