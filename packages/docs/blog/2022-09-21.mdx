```jsx title=example.ts
import { Analytics } from "@tlgr/analytics";
import { Console } from "@tlgr/analytics/plugins";
import { Telegraf } from "telegraf";

const bot = new Telegraf("<API TOKEN>");

const analytics = new Analytics(bot, new Console());

analytics.enable(true); // true - launch imidiately
bot.start((ctx) => {
  // send message
  ctx.reply(/** reply message */);
});

// fires event with start command, and reply text as param.
```

For now, when you want to reply message, you can use `JSX` markup.
